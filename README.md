This is a simple Java-SQL CRUD application.  I used Oracle Database for the SQL server. <br/>
This console application lets the user view, add, update, delete and search the product table in sql.<br/>
In order to run this file, [Oracle Database](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html) must be running
with proper log in. <br />
<br />
user-name: system<br />
password: system<br />
